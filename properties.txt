In C#, the get and set keywords are used to define the accessors for properties. They allow you to control how the values of properties are retrieved and assigned. The get accessor is used to retrieve the value of a property, while the set accessor is used to assign a new value to the property.

Let's consider a simple example of a Person class with a property called Name:


public class Person
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}


In the Person class, we have a private field name and a public property Name. The Name property has both get and set accessors.

The get accessor retrieves the value of the name field when the property is accessed. It uses the return keyword to return the value:


get { return name; }


The set accessor is used to assign a new value to the name field when the property is assigned a value. The assigned value is available in the value keyword, and we assign it to the name field:


set { name = value; }


public class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.Name = "Champak"; // The set accessor is called with "Champak"

        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + person.Name); // The get accessor is called to retrieve the value

        person.Name = "Popat"; // The set accessor is called with "Popat"
        
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + person.Name); // The get accessor is called again to retrieve the updated value
    }
}
Output
Name: Champak
Name: Popat
